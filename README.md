Hmm, That’s Funny

I have a basic beginner’s printer w/o a heated bed and have a problem with warping in the corners. Have tried warming the room, slathering glue stick on the print bed, and added brims which occasionally work. Rafts work pretty well but are difficult to remove from a large flat surface they were not intended to be used with like the “dungeon_stone_wall.floor.2x2.”   So I tried rotating the piece up on its edge which worked like a champ, perfectly flat and square, raft not too difficult to remove, and as a bonus I can print 16 at a time. However there is a funny side effect, the stone faces are very smooth due to the finer of resolution of the Z axis. Gone is the pixel-ation from the 0.2 layers at the surface of the stone while retaining the stone detail. Haven’t noticed any weakness in the piece with the change of layering.

Thought you might find this outcome interesting.
